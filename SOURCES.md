# Sources

Every source the build reads, with its license and where it is fetched from.
All are anonymous and keyless. A source is added here before its importer or
adapter is merged. If a source states no license, the entry says so.

## Base layer

### Overture Maps, places theme
- License: CDLA-Permissive-2.0. Rows that came from Foursquare are Apache-2.0
  (each row's `sources` says which).
- Fetched from: `https://overturemaps-us-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/release/<release>/theme=places/type=place/`
- Docs: https://docs.overturemaps.org/
- Attribution: Overture Maps Foundation, overturemaps.org.

### AllThePlaces
- License: CC0-1.0.
- Fetched from: `https://data.alltheplaces.xyz/runs/latest.json`, then the

- Used for: retail locations with a current cigarette, tobacco or vapor

### State alcohol license lists found on agency sites (2026-10-07)
None of these pages states a license; rows are marked `none-stated`. In
each, only the trading name and premises address are read, never the
licensee, owner, manager or phone columns, and nothing creates a place.
- Washington LCB: on-premises and off-premises spreadsheets linked from
  `https://lcb.wa.gov/records/frequently-requested-lists` (dated file names)
- New Jersey ABC: retail license report linked from
  `https://www.njoag.gov/about/divisions-and-offices/division-of-alcoholic-beverage-control-home/licensing-bureau-applications-and-information/licensing-reports/`
  (monthly). Licenses with an inactivity date are not read.
- Wisconsin DOR: `https://ww2.revenue.wi.gov/WebServicesPublicWeb/rest/liquor/all` (CSV)
- Nebraska LCC: roster linked from `https://lcc.nebraska.gov/licensing-sdl/active-license-roster`
- Maine BABLO: file linked from `https://www.maine.gov/dafs/bablo/liquor-licensing/license-data`
- Idaho State Police ABC: `https://apps.isp.idaho.gov/AbcReporting/license/search/csv?licenseTypes=retail&status=ISSUED`
- Arkansas ABC: `https://www.dfa.arkansas.gov/wp-content/uploads/FullPermitYYYYMM.xlsx` (monthly)
- Oklahoma ABLE: one list per license type linked from
  `https://oklahoma.gov/able-commission/brand-registration/brand-registration-reports/listing-of-licensees-by-license-type.html`
- Not used yet: Massachusetts ABCC publishes its active retail licenses as
  an old binary .xls (`https://www.mass.gov/doc/abcc-active-retail-licenses/download`),
  which needs a reader the build does not have. On a second fetch the
  site answered "Not allowed" to this project's User-Agent, so it is left
  alone.
- Looked for and not found as a file: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois,
  Michigan, Virginia, North Carolina, Arizona, Minnesota, South Carolina,
  Louisiana, Kansas, Utah, Vermont (search forms or blocked pages), and
  Indiana (sold per record).

### State alcohol registers read through their search forms (2026-10-07)
None states a license; rows are marked `none-stated`. Owner, licensee,
corporation and agent columns are not read.
- North Carolina ABC Commission: `https://abc2.nc.gov/Search/Permit`, asked
  once per county for active permits, reading the form's own spreadsheet
  export (200 requests). No robots.txt.
- Kentucky ABC: `https://abcportal.ky.gov/BelleExternal/ReportGenerator/Reports`,
  the "All Active Licenses" report for the whole state, reading its CSV
  export (4 requests). No robots.txt.
- Kansas ABC: `https://www.kdor.ks.gov/apps/liquorlicensee/LiquorLicenseeSearch.aspx`,
  asked once per license group, 500 rows a page (about 20 requests).
  robots.txt allows the page.
- Pennsylvania PLCB: the CSV of all licenses linked from its search page,
  `https://plcbplus.pa.gov/pub/LicenseExport.aspx` (2 requests). The
  site's robots.txt disallows everything except the search pages. The
  owner decided on 2026-10-07 to read the export anyway: it is the board's
  own public download button, and it is fetched once a month. Licenses in
  safekeeping are held, not used.
- Not read, because the site says no:
  - Tennessee's retail food list (`tnlcp.lcp.tracefirst.com`): robots.txt
    disallows the whole site.
  - Michigan MLCC, Virginia ABC, Arizona DLLC, Alaska AMCO: the sites
    answer 403 or a challenge page to this project's fetches.

### Food registers read a page at a time (2026-10-07)
None states a license; rows are marked `none-stated`.
- Tennessee Department of Agriculture retail food stores:
  `https://tnlcp.lcp.tracefirst.com/public_weblinks/food-safety-retail`,
  657 pages of 15. The site's robots.txt disallows the whole site; the
  owner decided on 2026-10-07 to read public registers like this anyway.
- North Carolina environmental health inspections, all 100 counties:
  `https://public.cdpehs.com/NCENVPBL/`, each county's search page asked
  for its CSV six months at a time (800 requests). No robots.txt. The
  inspector column is not read. Asking for two years at once fails
  without an error for the largest counties, which is why it is split.
- The "Food Safety" inspection system nine states share
  (`.../Inspection/PublicInspectionSearch.aspx`), read county by county,
  15 establishments a page, by `adapters/usafoodsafety.py` on its own
  schedule (`.github/workflows/crawl.yml`):
  Alaska `adec.safefoodinspection.com`, Arkansas
  `foodserviceprod.adh.arkansas.gov`, Iowa `iowa.safefoodinspection.com`,
  Kansas `foodsafety.kda.ks.gov`, North Dakota `fims.doh.nd.gov`,
  Pennsylvania `www.pafoodsafety.pa.gov`, South Dakota
  `sddoh.safefoodinspection.com`, Vermont `vtdoh.safefoodinspection.com`,
  Wyoming `wda.safefoodinspection.com`. None has a robots.txt. Phone
  numbers are not read.
- Mapped and not read yet: Georgia's statewide system
  (`ga.healthinspections.us/stateofgeorgia/`, five establishments a
  request); Kentucky, Illinois counties and Salt Lake County on
  `public.cdpehs.com` (other pages of the vendor North Carolina uses); Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Maine state
  sites. See FOLLOWUPS.md.
- Closed to this project: `inspections.myhealthdepartment.com` (Tennessee
  and Virginia restaurants, Hawaii, Oregon, Cuyahoga County and others)
  answers 403; Riverside, Santa Clara, St. Louis County and Baltimore
  County sit behind challenge pages.

### Statewide food establishment lists found on agency sites (2026-10-07)
None states a license; rows are marked `none-stated`.

- Minnesota Department of Agriculture retail food handlers (grocers and
  the like, not restaurants): the license lookup's text download at
  `https://www2.mda.state.mn.us/webapp/lis/LisResults.jsp`
- Not used: Vermont's food and lodging layer is a working map for
  inspectors, not a published dataset. Hawaii's and Rhode Island's files
  are years old. In most other states restaurants are licensed by counties
  and the state has a search form only.

### California Department of Consumer Affairs, licensee files
- License: none stated ("licensee data suitable for disclosure"); rows are
  marked `none-stated`.
- Fetched from: the shared folder linked from
  `https://www.dca.ca.gov/consumers/public_info/index.shtml`
  (`https://dca.box.com/s/oss6hf8jys2bmgxqd2gdz7w4oepm2il9`), folders for
  Barbering and Cosmetology, Automotive Repair and Pharmacy.
- Used for: establishment and barber shop licenses, automotive repair
  dealers, smog and safety inspection stations, retail pharmacies (open).
- Privacy: the files are mostly individual licensees, which are not read.
  Only rows marked as organizations are read, and nothing creates a place.
- Not used: licenses marked delinquent (12,600 salons, 8,200 repair
  dealers). An ended registration has not passed as a closure signal
  elsewhere (SPEC.md section 7), and this one has not been tested.

### Virginia DPOR, Texas and Ohio boards of pharmacy

- Virginia DPOR current license lists for shop occupations:
  `https://www.dpor.virginia.gov/RegulantLists`. The individual name and

  are not read.

- Fetched from: `https://data.hrsa.gov/DataDownload/DD_Files/Health_Center_Service_Delivery_and_LookAlike_Sites.csv`
- Used for: active permanent sites (open), with positions.

### State child care licensing layers
California's is CC BY (California Department of Social Services); the
others state no license and are marked `none-stated`. Only centers are
read, never family child care homes, and never the contact, owner,
director, phone or email columns.

- Not used: Maryland (a May 2024 snapshot), Kentucky (the layer stops at
  exactly 2,001 rows).

  rows, no positions).
