"""Colorado Liquor Enforcement Division: liquor licenses.

led_co        an active license for a premises (restaurant, tavern, store,
              brewery, club and the like), open as of the day the dataset
              was last updated.
The companion list of recently expired and surrendered licenses is not
used: it is a few hundred rows statewide, "expired" often means a renewal
that is late, and the 14 that matched in a Denver box were too few to test.
Each run adds it to data/cache/held/led_co_ended.csv so the records add up;
the build does not read that file.

Permits that ride on another license (takeout, delivery, sidewalk, storage),
shippers, importers, wholesalers and festival permits are left out. Rows
without a position go to the Census geocoder.

Public domain, as stated on the datasets.
