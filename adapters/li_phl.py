"""Philadelphia Licenses and Inspections: business licenses.

li_phl  an active license held by a company for a food business, a motor
        vehicle repair or fuel business, a child care facility, a tire or
        precious metal dealer, open as of the day the file was read.
        Positions come with the data.

Most of this dataset is rental licenses, which are not places in this
project's sense, and licenses held by individuals; both are left out, along
with vendors, dumpsters, tow trucks and event permits.

OpenDataPhilly. City of Philadelphia public record.
