"""Texas Comptroller: storefront locations permitted to collect sales tax.

cpa_tx  a location with a live permit (no out-of-business date), open as of
        the day the dataset was last updated.

The Comptroller also gives an out-of-business date for 450,000 locations,
but it is not emitted. Tested in a Houston box on places with no brand and
no live permit under the same name: other evidence said still open 87 times
and closed 85. The date marks one taxpayer leaving; the shop often carries
on under the next one.

Only storefront trades are read (retail, food and lodging, repair and
personal services, recreation), and not the non-store retailers, who are
mostly people selling from home. The taxpayer's own name and address are
not read; only the outlet's. Rows are evidence for places that are already
listed; nothing here creates a place. No positions; addresses go to the
Census geocoder.

Set CPA_TX_CITY to read one city only (for testing).

Public domain, as stated on the dataset.
