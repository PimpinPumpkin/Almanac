"""New York City DCWP: licensed businesses.

dcwp_nyc  a business premises with an active license from the Department of
          Consumer and Worker Protection (tobacco and electronics shops,
          secondhand dealers, laundries, garages, hotels, pawnbrokers, car
          washes and more), open as of the day the dataset was last updated.
          Positions come with the data.

Licenses held by a person rather than a premises are left out, and so are
trades with no shop a customer visits (home improvement contractors, debt
collectors, process servers, tow trucks, delivery services).
