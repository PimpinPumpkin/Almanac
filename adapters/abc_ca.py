"""California ABC daily license export: premises licensed to sell alcohol.

abc_ca  issued, active retail licenses (bars, restaurants, stores, breweries,
        tasting rooms), open as of the "Updated" date in the file's first
        line. The trade name (DBA) is used when there is one.

Surrendered, suspended and revoked licenses are in the file with no date of
the change, so they are not emitted. Applications, caterer and event
permits, wholesalers and importers are left out: none is a premises a
person can walk into. The file has no positions; addresses are sent to the
Census geocoder, and the ones it cannot place are matched by address.

The download page states no license. California public record.
