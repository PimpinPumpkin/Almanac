# Vela Almanac spec

Version 0.1. This describes what the code in this repo does today. Where a
choice is still open it says so.

## 1. What a place is

One row per physical place a person could walk into or stand in front of: a
shop, a restaurant, a bank branch, a school, a park, a monument. Not a
machine or a box (ATMs, bike share docks, parcel lockers, charging points,
bus stops), and not an agent counter inside another store.

## 2. Layers and build order

The build order is fixed by licensing (section 8), not by convenience.

1. **Overture places** is the spine. Duplicate listings inside Overture are
   merged first (section 6), then every remaining row is a place.
2. **AllThePlaces** rows (brand lineage only) join the Overture place they
   match, or become new places.
3. Evidence that does not come from OSM is attached. The result is the
   **core layer**.
   Open storefront rows from registers that matched nothing are added as
   places here too (section 6).
4. **OpenStreetMap** named features join the core place they match, or become
   new places. OSM evidence is attached. The result is the **full layer**.

Nothing made in steps 1 to 3 reads OSM data. A place keeps the same id in
both layers.

## 3. Place schema

Both layers have the same columns.

| column | type | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | string | stable id, section 4 |
| name | string | from the anchor source |
| category | string | The source's own term: an Overture taxonomy term, an OSM style `key=value` for AllThePlaces and OSM rows, or a coarse word for places minted from registers. |
| category_group | string | One of Overture's thirteen top-level groups (food_and_drink, shopping, health_care, services_and_business, and so on), for every row whatever its source. `sql/groups.sql` maps OSM tags and register categories onto them. Null when the source gave no category. |
| brand, brand_wikidata | string | |
| address, city, region, postcode | string | address is the street line |
| phone, website | string | |
| opening_hours | string | in OpenStreetMap's `opening_hours` syntax, null when no source has them |
| hours_source | string | `atp` (read from the brand's own store page by AllThePlaces) or `osm` (full layer only) |
| hours_date | date | when that source last collected or edited the record |
| status | string | open, closed or unknown, section 7 |
| status_date | date | date of the evidence that decided the status |
| status_source | string | source of that evidence |
| open_score | double | rough chance the place is open on the build date, 0 to 1, section 7 |
| openpois_conf | double | OpenPOIs' confidence that the place exists and is open, full layer only, null when OpenPOIs does not list it |
| missing_license | boolean | true for a bar in a state with a complete license list when no active license matched it. Null where the question does not apply. Section 7. |
| overture_status | string | Overture's own operating_status, carried as is. It has no date and does not feed status. |
| sources | list of {source, id} | every source row this place was built from |
| licenses | list of string | licenses of the inputs that touched the row, for credit. It is not the row's own license: every row is part of this database and is under the ODbL, whatever its inputs were |
| evidence | list of {source, source_id, state, date, rule, dist_m} | every evidence record, newest first |
| lat, lng | double | plain columns so row group statistics work |
| geometry | point | GeoParquet, WGS 84 |

Attributes come from the anchor source. Gaps (phone, website, brand, address)
are filled from one matched AllThePlaces row, then one matched OSM row.

## 4. Stable ids

An id is the id of the source row the place is anchored on, with a prefix:

- `ovt:<Overture id>` for every place with an Overture row. Overture ids
  (GERS) are stable across Overture releases.
- `atp:<spider>/<ref>` for a place only AllThePlaces has. `ref` is the
  chain's own store number.
- `osm:<n|w|r><OSM id>` for a place only OSM has.
- `alm:<source>/<source_id>` for a place minted from a register row
  (section 6).

Nothing is renumbered between builds, so a reader can diff two monthly files
on `id`. When Overture listings are merged as duplicates, the smallest id of
the group is the place id and the others stay in `sources`.

Measured on Overture alone, District of Columbia box, release 2026-08-19.0
against 2026-09-23.1: 76,147 of 78,098 ids carried over (97.5%), 1,951
disappeared, 18,041 were new.

Known gap: when a place that was `atp:` or `osm:` last month gains an
Overture match this month, its id becomes the `ovt:` one. The old id is
still in the row's `sources`, so a reader can follow the change. If this
churn turns out to matter, the fix is for the build to read the previous
file and keep the old id. It is not built because the churn has not been
measured; the second monthly build will measure it.

## 5. Evidence format

Every adapter writes one CSV with exactly these columns:

| column | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| source | adapter and list, for example `fdic_history` |
| source_id | the register's own id for the record |
| name | the name the public would see on the building |
| address | street line, city, state and ZIP in one string, street number first |
| lat, lng | WGS 84. May be blank when the address ends in a ZIP code; the record is then matched by address. |
| state | `open` or `closed` |
| date | ISO date. For open: the day the source says the place was operating. For closed: the day it closed. |

Rules for adapters:

- One file per source in `adapters/`, no shared state, standard library only.
- One current state per `source_id`. If the register has a history, emit the
  newest state.
- Rows with no date or no name, or with neither a position nor a ZIP code,
  are dropped and counted.
- A US register with addresses but no positions can ask for them:
  `out.close(geocode=True)` sends the addresses to the Census Bureau's
  batch geocoder and caches every answer. It places about 9 in 10. A
  geocoded point sits on the street, often 50 to 100 m from the door, so
  these registers match by house number but do not mint places or drive
  the missing-license flag.
- If the register uses a legal name the public never sees, the adapter maps
  it (see `TRADE_NAMES` in `adapters/fdic.py`). The matcher stays generic.
- A register that only publishes its last few weeks can be held instead of
  used: `Writer(name, held=True)` writes to `data/cache/held/` and keeps
  the rows from earlier runs. The build does not read held files. The
  scheduled build carries them from one release to the next as
  `held.tar.gz`.
- A record is evidence only if it says something about the premises. A
  record that only says something about paperwork is not (see SNAP end dates
  in section 9).

Signals that arrive by id rather than by position (Foursquare closing dates,
OSM tags, AllThePlaces rows) use the same evidence shape inside the build
but skip the matcher.

## 6. Entity matching

One matcher, `match_pairs` in `sql/lib.sql`, is used for AllThePlaces to
Overture, OSM to core, and evidence to places.

**Name.** Lowercase, strip accents and punctuation, `&` becomes `and`. Then
drop legal words (the, inc, llc, ltd, corp, company, co, national
association, na, branch) and trailing store numbers. Every spelling of
"credit union" (FCU, Federal Credit Union) becomes one word, so a credit
union matches itself and not the agency it is named after.

**House number.** The leading digits of the street line.

**Name similarity.**

| value | when |
| --- | --- |
| 1.0 | normalized names are identical |
| 0.9 | the shorter name, at least 4 letters, is the leading words of the longer: "giant" and "giant food" |
| Jaro-Winkler | otherwise, on the names with spaces removed. Counts only at 0.95 or more. |
| 0 | one side is an ATM and the other is not |

**Rules.** A pair matches under the first rule it passes.

| rule | house numbers | distance | name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| number | equal | up to 250 m | 1.0, 0.9, or Jaro-Winkler from 0.95 |
| near | missing on one or both sides | up to 60 m | same |
| spot | present and different | up to 30 m | 1.0 only |

| address | equal | none: same ZIP code and same first word of the street name | same as number |

The `address` rule is only for records that have no position (CMS, NPPES,
IRS). Chains repeat names, so the name alone never matches. Two branches of a
chain across the street from each other have different house numbers and
fail `number`; they are more than 30 m apart or fail `spot`.

**Who gets the match.**

- Base merge: each incoming row joins the single best place (rule order
  number, near, spot; then similarity; then distance). A place can absorb
  several rows.
- Evidence: a `number` match applies to every place that passes, because
  the base has duplicate listings of the same shop. Without a `number`
  match, only the best single place gets the record.

**Duplicates inside Overture.** The same matcher runs Overture against
itself, but only the strictest case merges: same house number, within
250 m, identical normalized name. In the District of Columbia box that
merges 303 of 94,188 rows; 40 merged pairs were read and all 40 are the same
business (often a store and the money transfer counter inside it). The
looser cases are rejected, section 9.

**Places minted from a register.** Some registers list the storefront
itself: FDIC branches, SNAP authorized stores, DC and New York licensed
premises, New York City and Chicago inspected food businesses, New York
salons, barber shops, repair shops, dealers and food stores, Delaware and
Sacramento County inspected food establishments, and Jefferson County,
Kentucky licensed premises. A row
from one of them becomes a new place when it is open, has a position,
matched no place, and no listed place within 80 m has a similar name
(leading words, Jaro-Winkler 0.7 or more, or same house number and same
first word), and no place within 200 m has the same name. A register name
that ends in a legal form (Inc, Corp, LLC) is a company, not a sign, and
does not become a place. Registers without positions (California licenses, NCUA) do
not mint. The place gets the register's name as written, a coarse category
(bank, grocery_or_convenience_store, licensed_premises), and the register
row as its first evidence.

In the District of Columbia box this adds about 520 places to 94,000.
Forty were read against their most similar neighbor: 39 were new, 1 was a
second listing of a place under a longer name (that case is now caught).
About one in five then picked up an OSM feature in the full layer, which
is independent confirmation that the place exists.

**Join shape.** Candidates come from a grid hash join: cells are 0.004
degrees of latitude by 0.008 of longitude, one side is copied into its nine
neighbor cells, and the join is an equality on the cell. No distance
predicate, OR, or correlated subquery is used to find candidates.

**Tests.** `tests/match_test.sql` holds 25 invented pairs, plus 5 for the address rule, one per case the
rules are meant to accept or refuse. Run `duckdb < tests/match_test.sql`.

**Measured.** 40 matched pairs per rule were read in the District of
Columbia box, fewer where a rule has fewer than 40. "Right" means the two
rows are the same place.

## 7. Status rules

Evidence is a list of dated open and closed records per place.

- **closed**: the place has a closed record with a date, and no open record
  dated after it. Any open record counts, whatever its source. The newest
  closed record supplies `status_date` and `status_source`.
- **open**: the newest record is open and is dated within 730 days of the
  build date.
- **unknown**: everything else. That includes places with no evidence, which
  is most of them, and places whose only evidence is an old open record.

Closed does not expire. A place closed in 2014 with nothing newer stays
closed.

A closed record that a newer open record overrode stays in `evidence`, so
the conflict is visible. Overture's confidence, update_time and
operating_status are never evidence: none carries a date of observation.

### Open score

`open_score` puts every place on one scale, including the ones with no
evidence. It is a rule of thumb with stated parts, not a fitted model.

| case | score |
| --- | --- |
| status is closed | 0.10 |
| newest evidence is open | 0.97 x 0.90 ^ years since that date, never below 0.75 |
| newest evidence is open but it overrode an older closing record | 0.80 x 0.90 ^ years, never below 0.50 |
| no evidence, Overture says permanently_closed | 0.30 |
| no evidence, `missing_license` is true | 0.30 |
| no evidence, OpenPOIs confidence 0.80 or more (full layer) | that confidence |
| no evidence otherwise | 0.75 |

The 0.90 a year assumes about one business in ten closes each year. The
0.30 comes from this build: of places Overture marks permanently_closed that
OSM can speak to, 7 were surveyed open and 20 were tagged closed.

Check, all four test regions: the score from the core layer, which has seen
no OSM data, against what OSM says about the same place.

| OSM says | places | mean core score | scored 0.30 or less | scored 0.80 or more |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| closed (lifecycle tag) | 338 | 0.64 | 65 | 12 |
| open (surveyed in the last 2 years) | 2,771 | 0.82 | 11 | 861 |

So a low score is rarely wrong about an open place (11 of 2,771), but the
core layer only catches 65 of 338 known closures. The score is honest about
what the evidence says and no better than the evidence. The 0.75 for no
evidence is likely low: among places with no core evidence that OSM can
speak to, 1,899 were surveyed open and 261 tagged closed (88% open), though
mappers survey open places more readily than they tag closed ones.

### OpenPOIs

OpenPOIs publishes two things this build does not compute: events from
OSM's edit history matched to Overture places, and a calibrated confidence
per place. Both were checked in the District of Columbia box against the
core layer, which uses no OSM data.

History events as closures: 390 places. Independent evidence said open
after the event 7 times and closed 99 times, the best ratio of any closing
signal here. It adds about 280 closures to the box's 2,150. A sample of 36
that no other source had flagged read as real closures.

Confidence, against places this build knows about:

| OpenPOIs confidence | places | known open | known closed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| under 0.2 | 567 | 17 | 151 |
| 0.4 to 0.6 | 23,707 | 929 | 310 |
| 0.6 to 0.8 | 26,791 | 1,299 | 1,037 |
| 0.8 and up | 18,728 | 4,102 | 255 |

The bottom band is the history events again. The top band is reliable. The
middle does not separate open from closed (the 0.6 band has more known
closures than the 0.4 band), so only the top band is used: a place with no
evidence and a confidence of 0.80 or more takes that confidence as its
`open_score`. In the box that lifts 12,700 places off the flat 0.75.

### Why most "ended" lists fail and two pass

Nine registers that record an ended license, permit or registration were
tested as closures. Seven failed: SNAP end dates, French register
closures, Texas ended alcohol licenses, Texas sales tax out-of-business
dates, Oregon expired licenses, Sacramento business tax close dates, and
fuel tank removals. In each, the paperwork ends when
an owner or legal entity changes and the shop carries on.

Two pass, both limited to places with no brand: DC alcohol license
cancellations (1 open, 73 closed) and Chicago business license
cancellations (21 open, 292 closed, for sites with no live license). Both
record an explicit cancellation against a premises, not a lapse against a
taxpayer. The signals that work best are still the ones where someone saw
the place: an inspector's "out of business", a mapper's tag, Foursquare,
OSM edit history.

### Missing license

A bar cannot trade without an alcohol license, so in a state whose active
license list is complete, a bar that matches no license is suspect. Tested
in the District of Columbia, the one test area with such a list and with
positions on it.

| bars in DC | places | another source says open | another source says closed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| matched an active license | 228 | 32 | 3 |
| matched none | 560 | 17 | 131 |

Among the bars another source can speak to, no license means closed 89% of
the time. It is still not used as a closed verdict, for two reasons. The 17
open ones are real bars the matcher missed: the license is under another
trade name, or the bar sits inside a hotel or restaurant that holds the
license. And a sample of 40 unmatched bars with no other evidence held
several that looked like going concerns of that kind, so the true error
rate is likely higher than the 11% measured. Checking for another license
at the same address did not separate the two groups (bars with one: 9 open,
85 closed).

The same test in a New York City box, with the state's license list:

| bars in the box | places | another source says open | another source says closed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| matched an active license | 1,033 | 79 | 10 |
| matched none | 2,801 | 31 | 545 |

So the result is a flag and a lower score, not a status: `missing_license`
is true and `open_score` is 0.30 when there is no other evidence. In DC
that covers 390 bars. New York is on the list too. Restaurants and liquor stores are left alone: a
restaurant can run without a license, and liquor stores showed no signal
(2 open, 2 closed). California, Texas and Florida are not on the list:
their positions are geocoded and too many licenses miss their place. Among
unlicensed bars another source could check, Houston's were open 20 times
and closed 77, and Jacksonville's open 15 and closed 11, which is no
signal at all.

A current list can be stale. CMS still lists United Medical Center in
Washington as of 2026-07, and OSM tags it disused with an edit dated
2026-05. The list is newer, so the place comes out open, and the closing
record stays visible in `evidence`. One case in ten hospitals read; watch
this as more lists are added.

The ATP and OSM check_date rows were not in the brief. Being listed in a chain's own locator on
a known day, and a mapper's dated survey tag, are both dated records of
life, and both come for free with the base layer. Absence from a locator is
still not evidence of anything.

### Opening hours

Hours are carried, not judged. A place takes the hours of its newest
member that has any: an AllThePlaces record (dated by the day the spider
ran) or, in the full layer, an OSM feature (dated by its last edit, which
is not always an edit of the hours). Nothing checks them against anything
else yet, so `hours_date` is the reader's guide to how far to trust them.
On the DC test box that gives hours to 6% of all places and 24% of food
and drink; the core layer, with AllThePlaces alone, has 2%.

## 8. Licensing

| source | license | consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overture places | CDLA-Permissive-2.0 (rows from Foursquare are Apache-2.0) | attribution |
| AllThePlaces | CC0-1.0 | none |
| Foursquare OS Places | Apache-2.0 | keep the notice, see NOTICE |
| FDIC, USDA | US federal work, public domain | none |
| Wikidata | CC0-1.0 | none |
| OpenStreetMap | ODbL-1.0 | attribution and share-alike on any derived database |

A table that contains OSM-derived rows, or values computed from OSM, is an
ODbL derived database. That reaches further than the OSM-only rows: a core
place whose status was decided by an OSM lifecycle tag, or whose phone was
filled from OSM, is OSM-derived too.

**Decision: copyleft, with separable layers.**

- The code is AGPL-3.0-or-later.
- `places-<region>.parquet` is the core plus OSM. It must be under the ODbL.
- `core-<region>.parquet` is built without reading OSM. Its inputs are all
  permissive, so its license is a choice, and the choice is the ODbL as
  well, so that anything built on the Almanac stays open.
- The core layer is still built separately. That keeps the choice open: a
  file with no OSM in it can be offered under other terms later, a file
  with OSM in it never can.
- Every row carries `sources` and `licenses`, the licenses of the inputs
  that touched it.

What that asks of anyone who uses the files, closed source or not:

- show the credit line in NOTICE wherever the data, or anything made from
  it, is shown to the public;
- if they change the data or merge it into another database and let the
  public use the result, publish that database under the ODbL too;
- keep the notices with any copy.

An app does not have to open its own code to read the files, but it cannot
drop the credit, and it cannot keep an improved copy of the data to itself.
Public domain inputs do not weaken this: the license covers the merged
database, and nobody gets the matching, the statuses or the merged rows
except through it. One limit to be plain about: a single fact, such as one
shop's address, is not something any license can own.

Open point: whether the Wikidata P576 signal belongs in the core layer.
Wikidata is CC0, but the link from place to item comes from an OSM tag, so
for now it sits in the full layer only.

`SOURCES.md` records each source's license and URL. Sources with no stated
license (many city feeds) get an entry that says so before any adapter for
them is merged.

## 9. Rejected rules

Measured in the District of Columbia box unless noted. "Independent" means
evidence from a different source for the same place.

| rule | result | why it is out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SNAP End Date means closed | 499 places matched. Independent evidence said still open 98 times, closed 27 times. | An ended authorization is a change of owner or a store leaving the program far more often than a closing. The adapter reads these rows and emits nothing. |
| Foursquare `date_closed` matched by name and position, for rows Overture does not link by id | 2,142 places matched. Independent: open 101, closed 129. | Foursquare often closes one of its own duplicate records for a place that is still there. Joined by id the same field is good: open 6, closed 33. |
| Jaro-Winkler from 0.93 | 10 pairs read between 0.93 and 0.95: 2 wrong ("Embassy of Albania" and "Embassy of Mali"), 1 doubtful. 30 read at 0.95 and up: none wrong. | Threshold raised to 0.95. |
| Name contained anywhere in the longer name | Joined a shop to the mall it is named after, and a department to its hospital. | Only leading words count now. |
| A bank branch record matching the bank's ATM | 3 of 40 FDIC closings landed on an ATM or mortgage desk listing. | A name with ATM on one side only never matches. |
| Wikidata P576 on offices | 4 hits across two boxes, 2 of them a company merger date on an office building. | Skipped when the OSM feature is `office=*`. The 2 that remain (a hospital, a school) are right. |
| Merging Overture duplicates on anything looser than an identical name | Same house number with a leading-words or near-spelling match: about 10 of 21 read were a part and its whole (a gift shop and its hospital, two advisors at one bank). No house number: mostly junk pages sharing a point. Different numbers within 30 m: 13 pairs, several wrong. | Only same number plus identical name merges. |
| DC alcohol license cancellation means closed, for every license type | 283 places matched. Independent: open 18, closed 60. The open ones were grocery stores, hotels and places that had swapped one license for another. | Kept only for restaurants, taverns, nightclubs and clubs, and skipped when the same trade name has an active license at the address. After that: open 8, closed 54, in line with the Foursquare and OSM signals. |
| France: a closed SIRENE establishment means the place closed | Paris box, places whose newest SIRENE record was a closure: independent evidence said open 1,082, closed 647. Joined by SIRET id it was still open 130, closed 40. | A SIRET closes when a shop changes owner or legal form. Closed establishments are not emitted. |
| France: dating an active SIRENE record by the register's processing date | Nearly every record was processed in the last year. Dated that way, an active entry overrode 159 hand-tagged OSM closures and 152 Foursquare ones. | Dated by dateDebut, the last real change. Overrides fell to 39 and 14. Most SIRENE records are then old and inform `open_score` without setting a status. |
| A fuel site whose last underground tank was removed is closed (EPA) | Kentucky: 1,153 places matched. Independent: open 353, closed 15. | Tanks are replaced under a new record, and many sites are not fuel stations. Only sites with tanks in use are emitted, as open evidence. |
| Texas: a surrendered, cancelled or expired alcohol license means closed | Houston box, on-premise license types only, skipping names with an active license at the address: 1,212 places. Independent: open 79, closed 89. | Not emitted. |
| Chicago "Out of Business" inspections, for every place | Chicago box, places with no later inspection: independent open 63, closed 187. Split by whether the place carries a brand: chains open 36, closed 3; independents open 27, closed 184. | A chain outlet changes franchisee and license and carries on. The closure is kept for places with no brand only. The same limit now applies to DC license cancellations, which went from 8 open and 54 closed to 1 and 73. |
| Oregon: an expired on-premises alcohol license means closed | Portland box, places with no brand and no live license under the same name: independent open 6, closed 26. | 81% on a small sample is below the signals that are kept (87% and up). Not emitted. |
| Texas Comptroller out-of-business dates for sales tax locations | Houston box, places with no brand and no live permit under the same name: independent open 87, closed 85. | The date marks one taxpayer leaving; the shop often carries on under the next. Not emitted. Live permits are good open evidence: of 13,980 places with one, other sources called 79 closed and 5,053 open. |
| City of Sacramento close dates on business tax accounts | Sacramento box, places with no brand and no active account under the same name: independent open 33, closed 33. | Not emitted. |
| Overture operating_status as a closed verdict | 6,175 rows say permanently_closed, nearly all from one supplier, with no date. Where this build has dated evidence for them: closed 31, open 12. | No date, and wrong too often. Carried as `overture_status`, never used. |

Carried over from earlier work and not retested: website liveness, and
"missing from the chain's locator means closed".

## 10. Other countries

The base layer and four signals are global: Overture, OSM, AllThePlaces,
Foursquare closing dates, OSM lifecycle and survey tags, Wikidata. A region
with a country code in `regions.tsv` builds from those alone. Registers are
then added per country, as adapters that write to
`data/cache/evidence/<country>/`.

What is tied to a country:

- The house number is read from the front of the street line. Right for
  the US, UK and France; wrong where the number follows the street name
  (Germany, Spain, Italy), which needs its own rule before those are built.
- `street_key` skips French street types and articles as well as English
  compass words. Legal forms dropped from names include the French ones.
- State outlines, `missing_license` and places minted from registers are
  US only for now.

**France.** Test area: a Paris box (48.815 2.224 48.902 2.470). Register:
SIRENE, the national list of business establishments.

| | Paris box |
| --- | ---: |
| places | 207,916 |
| with a dated status | 41,514 (20%) |
| with any evidence | 41% |
| open, decided by OSM survey date | 22,922 |
| open, decided by chain locator | 8,831 |
| open, decided by SIRENE | 6,902 |
| closed, by OSM lifecycle | 1,629 |
| closed, by Foursquare | 1,220 |

OSM carries far more here than in the US: 37% of named OSM features in the
box have a survey date. SIRENE matched 69,000 places. 25 matches were read
per rule: number 24 of 25, near 22 of 25 (the misses are a related company
at the address, or a short name that is the start of a longer one). 18,000
more joined exactly, through the SIRET that mappers tag on OSM features.

## 11. Publishing

Per region: `core-<region>.parquet`, `places-<region>.parquet`,
`status-<region>.parquet` (id, status, status_date, status_source,
open_score and missing_license only, for readers that just join on id) and
`manifest-<region>.json`. Each release from the second one on also carries
`changes.parquet`: every place that appeared, vanished, closed, reopened,
was newly confirmed open, or went quiet since the release before, made by
`tools/changes.sql`. A real release has one region per state plus DC.

- GeoParquet, zstd, rows in Hilbert order, 20,000 rows per row group.
- `lat` and `lng` are ordinary double columns. A reader filtering
  `lat between .. and lng between ..` skips row groups by statistics, which
  works over HTTP range requests with DuckDB, pyarrow or GDAL. Prune on
  those, not on the geometry.
- The manifest lists the build date, the box, each source's release, and for
  each file its row count, size, license and SHA-256. It also carries the
  credit, so it travels with the data:

  | field | value |
  | --- | --- |
  | dataset | `Vela Almanac` |
  | license | `ODbL-1.0` |
  | credit | the credit line a reuser must show, as in NOTICE |
  | notice | URL of the NOTICE file with the source notices |
  | region, build_date, bbox | what was built and when |
  | country, iso_3166_2 | `US` and `US-NY`, so a reader can map a file to its own regions without knowing ours (null for a test box) |
  | osm_extracts | the Geofabrik extract names the region was built from |
  | sources | the release of each base source |
  | files | name, layer, license, rows, bytes, sha256 per file |
- First host: GitHub release assets, one release per monthly build, tagged
  with the build date. The release also carries `manifest.json`, which
  lists every region's files. The scheduled workflow pins one Overture
  release and one AllThePlaces run for the whole build. The
  largest state should come out near 200 MB, well under the 2 GB cap
  (Kentucky is 25 MB for 247,000 places).

State builds are clipped to the Census state outline (cartographic
boundary file, 1:500,000, public domain). The outline is generalized, so a
row just outside it is kept when its own address names the state and it is
within about 5 km.
